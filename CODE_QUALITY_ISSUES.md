# Code Quality Issues

1. **Redundant Middleware**
   - `app.use('/auth', authRoutes);` is called twice in `app.js`. This causes unnecessary duplicate processing.

2. **Missing Error Handling**
   - No error handling on `sequelize.sync()` in `app.js`.

3. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Business logic is handled directly in route files instead of using services/controllers (addressed in updated version).

4. **Lack of Logging and Validation**
   - No input validation on incoming requests.
   - No centralized logging for error tracking.
